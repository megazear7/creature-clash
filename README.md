## Development Strategy

> Eventually we will want to do branching instead of committing directly to the master branch.
However, lets try to learn one thing at a time.

1. Choose an issue from the [Static Website](https://github.com/megazear7/creature-clash/projects/1) GitHub project to work on and move the issue into the 'In Progress' column.
1. Make small commits with meaningful and descriptive commit messages.
1. When you feel like you are done with the issue, move the issue into the 'Ready for Review' column and add a comment with an @megazear7 tag, explaining the work you did.
1. If @megazear7 feels like it is sufficiently resolved he will move the issue into the 'Done' column. Otherwise he will move it back into the 'In Progress' column with a comment explaining what needs fixed.
